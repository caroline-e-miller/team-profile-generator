# team-profile-generator

## Description

The team profile generator is an application that allows the user to create, post, and utilize contact information for themselves and their team members. The produced webpage has one informational card for each team member that contains their names, employee ID numbers, emails, and unique contact information.

## Usage

The user will be prompted with a series of questions about the manager, and then prompted to choose between adding an engineer, intern, or "finished." If the engineer or intern is chosen, then the user can keep adding information for each person. Once the user has written all the information they need, they select "finished" in the command line and the page is generated as an HTML file.
